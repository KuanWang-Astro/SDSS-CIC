Constraints on the (decorated) halo occupation distribution model from SDSS data.
In each figure, the blue contours show constraints from galaxy number density $n_g$ and projected two point correlation $w_p$, and the cyan contours show constraints from $n_g$, $w_p$, and counts-in-cylinders $P(N_{\rm CIC})$.

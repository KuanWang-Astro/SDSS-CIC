Constraints on the (decorated) halo occupation distribution model from SDSS data.
In each figure, the blue contours show constraints from galaxy number density ng and projected two point correlation wp, and the cyan contours show constraints from ng, wp, and counts-in-cylinders P(N_CIC).
The name of each figure specifies the corresponding sample (Mr < -21.0, -20.5, -20.0, -19.5, -19.0) and model (standard/decorated HOD).
